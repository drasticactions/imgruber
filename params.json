{"name":"Imgruber","tagline":"An extremely abbreviated screenshot pipeline","body":"_Named in homage of the un(der?)-appreciated Will Forte vehicle. Like its namesake, I expect this project to make no money._\r\n\r\n##What even is this\r\nImgruber is my attempt to reduce my screenshot-to-URL time as much as possible. Its original objective was to make gamedev tweets and forum posts less time consuming to make, but can be used for whatever. Go nuts.\r\n\r\n##How to make it do the thing\r\nRun the program. It'll post up in your task tray. From there, double-click its icon or push Print Screen (by default). Your cursor should turn into a selection crosshair. Click and drag a rectangle. As long as you have a working internet connection, it'll upload your cropped screenshot anonymously to imgur and copy the URL directly into your clipboard.\r\n\r\n##How to make it do the other thing\r\nIf you right click on the task tray icon and select \"Configuration\" you can change the hotkey.\r\nYou can also make it automatically (well sorta) tweet for you, if you're logged in to twitter on your default browser. If enabled, it'll open a new window or tab and prime a tweet with your imgur link. It'll even prepend some text if you add it here.\r\n\r\n##How to make it stop doing the thing\r\nRight click on the task tray icon. Click \"Close\".\r\n\r\n##It does not do the thing properly\r\nGet at me:","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
